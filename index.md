Welcome to my site!

I am a PhD candidate from the Department of Communication at Stanford University. I am working with Prof. Jeff Hancock in the [Social Media Lab](sml.stanford.edu). I completed my Master's degree in Communication at [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://communication.illinois.edu/) and my undergraduate degree at [Renmin University of China](http://jcr.ruc.edu.cn/en/).

My research examines interpersonal and psychological dynamics via communication technologies (social media, virtual reality, live video streaming, etc.) using lab experiments, and investigates the psychological processes and outcomes language can reflect and impact using computational methods with large-scale datasets.

See Research for how I address these questions:

[What psychological processes and outcomes does language reflect and predict?](/research/<a name="What psychological processes and outcomes does language reflect and predict?"></a>)

[How do people perceive and react to information on social media?](/research/<a id="How do people perceive and react to information on social media?"></a>)

[How is social media use associated with psychological well-being?](/research/)

[How does technology alter self-presentation and self-identity?](/research)
