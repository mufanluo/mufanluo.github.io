Welcome to my site! I am a PhD candidate from the Department of Communication at Stanford University. I am working with Prof. Jeff Hancock in the Social Media Lab. 

My research examines interpersonal and psychological dynamics via communication technologies (social media, virtual reality, live streaming, etc.) and how language can reflect and predict these dynamics. 

My primary line of research addresses the questions about 
- How do people perceive and share information on social media
- How is social media use associated with psychological well-being
- What drives shared attention and whether shared attention can restore the need to belong in the emerging media environment
- How can computer-mediated communication and communication via virtual reality shape self-concept and self-identity?
