Welcome to my site! I am a PhD candidate from the Department of Communication at Stanford University. I am working with Prof. Jeff Hancock in the Social Media Lab. 

My research examines interpersonal and psychological dynamics via communication technologies (social media, virtual reality, live streaming, etc.) and how language can reflect and predict these dynamics. 

My primary lines of research examine
- individuals' information processing in social media 
- the association between social media use and psychological well-being
- the motives and effects of shared attention on belongingness in the digital media environment 
- self-perception and identity in immersive media and text-based computer-mediated communication
