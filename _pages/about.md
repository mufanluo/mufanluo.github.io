Welcome to my site! I am a PhD candidate from the Department of Communication at Stanford University. I am working with Prof. Jeff Hancock in the Social Media Lab [http:]. 

My research examines interpersonal and psychological dynamics via communication technologies (social media, virtual reality, live streaming, etc.) and how language can reflect and predict these dynamics. 

I use laboratory experiments and observational data analysis to understand 
* individuals' information processing in social media 
* the association between social media use and psychological well-being
* the motives and impacts of shared media experience on social connectedness in the digital media environment 
* self-perception and identity in immersive media and text-based computer-mediated communication
