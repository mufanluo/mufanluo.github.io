### How do people perceive and react to online information?

Do people tend to perceive a news headline on social media as real or fake? How accurately can people detect real (fake) from fake (real) news? We examine the truth-bias and detection accuracy of individuals' perceptions of news headlines, and how social endorsement heuristics may affect these dynamics.

Coviewing as a coping strategy to restore need to belong.

### What are the impacts of technologies on self-construct and identity?

Self-presentation and social interaction via mediated communication not only affect how others perceive us but also how we see ourselves. We examine the production and impacts of humblebrag - a unique self-presentation strategy pervasive on social media, the impacts of VR on stereotype threat through virtual learning and performance, and the roles of social evaluation in identity shift.
