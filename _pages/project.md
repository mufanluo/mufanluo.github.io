## What language can reflect and predict social processes?

People share media experience with others in everyday life. Live streaming technologies facilitate the shared experience by allowing people to view and communicate synchronously. Do people use different language when watching a live stream video with others in real time relative to watching an archived video afterwards? Can language characteristics shed lights on psychological mechanisms behind shared-attention? We collect and analyze comment data on YouTube live stream videos to address these questions.

Fake news has become subject to serious scrutiny since the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. We combine dictionary and supervised machine learning methods to understand the linguistic differences between fake and real news articles and to build a statistical model that can classify news as fake or real.

## How do people perceive and react to online information?

Do people exhibit a natural inclination to perceive a news headline on social media as real or fake? How accurately can people detect both types of news, compared to messages in human interaction? We examine the truth-bias and detection accuracy of individuals' perceptions of news headlines, and how social endorsement heuristics may affect these dynamics.

Social media can extend the reach of health campaign messages via retransmission. What factors may drive message retransmission on Facebook? We examine the effects of opinion climate, message efficacy, and publicness feature of social media on retransmission.

## How is social media use associated with psychological well-being?

We conduct systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the associations and mechanisms linking the two constructs.

## What are the impacts of technologies on self-construct and identity?

Self-presentation and social interaction via mediated communication not only affect how others perceive us but also how we see ourselves. We examine the production and impacts of humblebrag - a unique self-presentation strategy pervasive on social media, the impacts of VR on stereotype threat through virtual learning and performance, and the roles of social evaluation in identity shift.
