## How Do People Perceive and React to Online Information?

Do people tend to perceive a news headline on social media as real or fake? How accurately can people detect real (fake) from fake (real) news? We examine the truth-bias and detection accuracy of individuals' perceptions of news headlines, and how social endorsement heuristics may affect these dynamics.

Social media can extend the reach of health campaign messages via retransmission. What factors may drive message retransmission on Facebook? We examine the effects of opinion climate, message efficacy, and publicness feature of social media on retransmission.

## How Does Social Media Use Associate With Psychological Well-being?

We conduct systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the associations and mechanisms linking the two constructs.

## How Does Shared Media Experience Affect Our Emotions and Social Well-being?

People share media experience with others in everyday life. Live streaming technologies facilitate the shared experience by allowing people to view and communicate synchronously. We use large-scale field data and lab experiments to understand the amplification and psychological impacts of shared experience.

## What Are the Impacts of Technologies on Self-construct and Identity?

Self-presentation and social interaction via mediated communication not only affect how others perceive us but also how we see ourselves. We examine the production and impacts of humblebrag - a unique self-presentation strategy pervasive on social media, the impacts of VR on stereotype threat through virtual learning and performance, and the roles of social evaluation in identity shift.
