Welcome to my site! I am a PhD candidate from the Department of Communication at Stanford University. I am working with Prof. Jeff Hancock in the [Social Media Lab](sml.stanford.edu). I completed my Masters degree at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and my undergraduate degree at Renmin University of China.

My research examines interpersonal and psychological dynamics via communication technologies (social media, virtual reality, live video streaming, etc.) using lab experiments, and examines what language and text can reflect and impact social processes using computational methods with large-scale dataset.
